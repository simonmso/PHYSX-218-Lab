1.  What are the value of  α±δα?
	Aluminum: α = 2.72e-05 ± 2.71e-07
	Copper: α = 1.86e-05 ± 2.45e-07

2.  What are the accepted values of  α±δα?
	Aluminum: α = 2.1e-05 - 2.4e-05
	Copper: α = 1.6e-05 - 1.7e-05

3.  Do your results agree with accepted values?
	My results do not agree with the accepted values. 
	Both the accepted values for copper and aluminum fall outside the range of uncertainty of my values.
											
4. If your results do not agree within uncertainties to the accepted values, suggest possible reasons as to why.
	My uncertainties suggest that systematic errors are present, as the lab results are decently precise but wholly inaccurate.
	Most likely, the lab equipment was inefficient both in its transfer of heat (never reaching close to 99°C) and its measurement of heat.
	Were the pipe to have reached the same length under 99°C, recalculation shows that the values for α fall within accepted values.

5.  Is the value for α constant in copper regardless of the axis along which the thermal expansion is measured?
	Copper is not isotropic, so theoretically the value for α varies.
